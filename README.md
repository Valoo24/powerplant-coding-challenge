# Powerplant Coding Challenge — Solution

This repository contains my solution to the [GEM / ENGIE SPaaS coding challenge](https://github.com/gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge). The challenge consists of building a REST API that solves the **unit commitment problem**: given a forecasted electricity load and a set of available powerplants, determine how much power each plant should produce to meet the demand at minimum cost, while respecting each plant's operational constraints (Pmin, Pmax).

The production plan is computed using a **merit-order algorithm** — plants are ranked by their real cost per MWh (wind at zero cost, then gas-fired, then turbojet) and activated in that order until the load is satisfied. Wind turbines are treated as all-or-nothing (non-throttleable) as per the challenge specification. The optional CO2 bonus is also implemented.

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 / ASP.NET Core
- MediatR (CQRS pipeline)
- FluentValidation (input validation via MediatR pipeline behavior)
- xUnit (unit tests)
- Docker

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) — for running locally
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) — for running in a container

## Configuration

### MediatR license key

MediatR v12+ requires a license key.

For local development, add it to `power-plant-coding-challenge-API/appsettings.Development.json`:

```json
{
  "MediatR": {
    "LicenseKey": "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
  }
}
```

For Docker, the key is injected via the `MediatR__LicenseKey` environment variable defined in `compose.yaml` — no additional setup needed.

### CO2 cost (bonus)

The CO2 surcharge on gas-fired plants is optional and controlled via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ProductionPlan": {
    "IncludeCo2Costs": true
  }
}
```

When enabled, each MWh produced by a gas-fired plant incurs an additional cost of `0.3 ton × co2_price (€/ton)`, which is factored into the merit-order calculation. Turbojet plants are not subject to this surcharge as per the challenge specification.

For Docker, this option is controlled via the `compose.yaml` environment variable:

```yaml
- ProductionPlan__IncludeCo2Costs=false  # set to true to enable CO2 costs
```

## Build

From the `power-plant-coding-challenge/` directory:

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Run

```bash
cd power-plant-coding-challenge/power-plant-coding-challenge-API
dotnet run
```

The API starts on **http://localhost:8888**.

## Endpoint

**POST** `/productionplan`

Example request bodies are available in `example_payloads/`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/productionplan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example_payloads/payload1.json
```

Example response:

```json
[
  { "name": "windpark1",               "p": 90.0  },
  { "name": "windpark2",               "p": 21.6  },
  { "name": "gasfiredbig1",            "p": 368.4 },
  { "name": "gasfiredbig2",            "p": 0.0   },
  { "name": "gasfiredsomewhatsmaller", "p": 0.0   },
  { "name": "tj1",                     "p": 0.0   }
]
```

Validation errors return HTTP 400 with a `ProblemDetails` body. Unexpected errors return HTTP 500.

## Run with Docker

From the `power-plant-coding-challenge/` directory:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The API starts on **http://localhost:8888** (the container listens on port 8080, mapped to 8888 on the host).

To stop the container:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Run tests

From the `power-plant-coding-challenge/` directory:

```bash
dotnet test
```
